# A MPG data set is a rectangular collection of variables (in the columns) and
# observations (in the rows). mpg contains observations collected by the
# US Environment Protection Agency on 38 models of cars.


# The ggplot() creates a coordinates system that you can add layer to.
# The first argument of ggplot() is the dataset to use in the graph. 
# So ggplot(data = mpg) creates an empty graph, but it's not very interesting
# To complete your graph by adding one or more layers to ggplot() adds a layer
# of points to your plot, which creates a scatterplot.
# Each geom function in ggplot2 takes a mapping argument. 
# This defines how variable in your dataset are mapped to visual properties.


ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = cyl, y = hwy))


# An aesthetic is a visual property of the objects in your plot.
# Aesthetic include thing like the size, the shape , or the color of you points.

# Geometric Objects

# A Geom is a geometrical object that a plot uses to represent data.
# People often describe plots by the type of geom that the plot uses.
# For example, bar charts use bar geoms, line charts use line geoms.
# Boxplots use boxplot geoms, and so on. Scatterplots break the trend:
# they use the point geom. As we see in the preceding plots, you can
# use different geoms to plot the same data.
# The plot on the left uses the point geom, and the plot on the right uses
# the smooth  geom, a smooth line fitted to the data.
# To change the geom in your plot, change the geom function that you add to 
# ggplot(). For instance, to make the preceding plots


# Left 
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

# Right
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))


# Every geom function in ggplot2 takes a mapping argument. However, 
# not every aesthetic works with every geom.
# You could set the
# shape of a point, but you couldn’t set the “shape” of a line. On the
# other hand, you could set the linetype of a line. geom_smooth() will
# draw a different line, with a different linetype, for each unique value
# of the variable that you map to linetype:
ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, linetype = drv))

# Here geom_smooth() separates the cars into three lines based on
# their drv value, which describes a car’s drivetrain.
# Here geom_smooth() separates the cars into three lines based on
# their drv value, which describes a car’s drivetrain. One line describes
# all of the points with a 4 value, one line describes all of the points
# with an f value, and one line describes all of the points with an r
# value. Here, 4 stands for four-wheel drive, f for front-wheel drive,
# and r for rear-wheel drive.

ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy, group = drv))


# To display multiple geoms in the same plot, add multiple geom
# functions to ggplot():

ggplot(data = mpg) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth()

# If you place mappings in a geom function, ggplot2 will treat them as
# local mappings for the layer. It will use these mappings to extend or
# overwrite the global mappings for that layer only. This makes it pos‐
# sible to display different aesthetics in different layers:

ggplot(data = mpg, mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(color = class)) +
  geom_smooth()


# You can use the same idea to specify different data for each layer.
# Here, our smooth line displays just a subset of the mpg dataset, the
# subcompact cars.
