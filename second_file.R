# A MPG data set is a rectangular collection of variables (in the columns) and
# observations (in the rows). mpg contains observations collected by the
# US Environment Protection Agency on 38 models of cars.


# The ggplot() creates a coordinates system that you can add layer to.
# The first argument of ggplot() is the dataset to use in the graph. 
# So ggplot(data = mpg) creates an empty graph, but it's not very interesting
# To complete your graph by adding one or more layers to ggplot() adds a layer
# of points to your plot, which creates a scatterplot.
# Each geom function in ggplot2 takes a mapping argument. 
# This defines how variable in your dataset are mapped to visual properties.

# An aesthetic is a visual property of the objects in your plot.

# the ggplot2 will only use six shapes at a time. By default, additional groups will go

# YOu can also set the aesthetic properties of your geom manually. For example,
# we can make all of the points in our plot blue.
